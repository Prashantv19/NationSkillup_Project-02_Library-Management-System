# 📚 Library Management System Using Java (Switch Statement)

Managing a library is a challenging task — from keeping track of books and their availability to managing student records and book transactions.
This mini-project demonstrates how to build a simple **Library Management System in Java** using **switch statements** and core OOP concepts.

---

## 🚀 Overview

In this project, we build a menu-driven library system where users can perform operations such as:

* Adding books
* Searching for books
* Registering students
* Borrowing and returning books
* Viewing records

The system is implemented using **multiple Java classes**, each handling a specific responsibility to maintain clean and readable code.

---

## ❓ Why Build This Project?

Building this Library Management System helps strengthen Java concepts by providing hands-on experience with:

* **Switch statements** for menu-driven applications
* **Object-Oriented Programming** (classes & objects)
* **Core operations** like search, add, update in a real-world scenario
* **Managing data** efficiently using custom classes

This project is perfect for beginners, students, and Java learners.

---

## ✨ Features

The system supports the following operations:

1. **Exit Application**
2. **Add a New Book**
3. **Upgrade Quantity of a Book**
4. **Search a Book**
5. **Show All Books**
6. **Register a Student**
7. **Show All Registered Students**
8. **Check Out a Book**
9. **Check In a Book**

## 🏗 Project Structure

This mini-project is split into **five Java files**, each handling a specific part of the library system.

| File Name       | Responsibility                                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `Library.java`  | Main application with menu and execution flow        |
| `book.java`     | Represents individual book details                   |
| `books.java`    | Manages the collection of books and their operations |
| `student.java`  | Represents individual student details                |
| `students.java` | Manages student records and book borrowing           |

> **Note:**
> Although Java naming conventions usually start class names with uppercase letters, small letters are intentionally used here for clarity and understanding.

---

## 🧩 How It Works

Each class has a clearly defined role:

* **`book.java`** → stores book data
* **`books.java`** → maintains list of books and provides operations
* **`student.java`** → stores student information
* **`students.java`** → manages student list and borrowing system
* **`Library.java`** → brings everything together with a switch-driven menu

This modular structure improves **readability**, **maintainability**, and keeps the overall code simple and clean.

## 📌 Conclusion

This Java-based Library Management System is a great learning project that covers:

* Switch-case control flow
* Object-oriented programming
* Managing collections of objects
* Implementing real-world operations
